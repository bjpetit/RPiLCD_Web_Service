# RPiLCD_Web_Service
Raspberry Pi Web Service to drive LCD Screen

This project was started to drive updates to an LCD screen on a Raspberry Pi

The code is written to receive APRS information from another service and print
basic information to the screen. 

This project uses Flask for Web Services and Adafruit_Python_CharLCD for LCD 
services

To run this service, install the required Python dependencies, such as Flask
and Adafruit_Python_CharLCD, then execute 

   python RPiLCD_Web_Service.py
   
   Then fire up a web service client and start sending data

This is a work-in-progress.
